# VroomPC
Its a simple Project to help Gamers get more Preformance with their low or Mid-End PCs
It allows Users to change the Power options and energy consomption, Disable background Apps, lowers the Resolution Timer response time and flushs the DNS.
and The last Function just resets everything back to normal to preserve power consomption and keep the life time of the hardware at optimal state.
Its fully written in Java and need Java Runtime Enviroment to run, and the GUI is deigned with Jframe .
I was Planning to Add Preformance Tracker and FPS counter, but i thought that It lower The Overall Prefomance by adding Trackers and Counter, so i decided to keep it as smiple and light as possible.
And to help maximizing the Preformance I would recommend to only turn the Programm on whil setting the function or reseting the setting, Because it doest need to be running in the background and the settings are directly saved to windows.
